To Do List for PGR testing
==========================

* Automatically set up iSCSI interfaces for user (and tear them down
  when done?)

* Add configuration file (for now) for device names (and keys?)

* Use libiscsi to get away from open-iscsi setup?

* Test the various Check Condition (Unit Attention) cases

* Test less obvious features, such as:
    - report-capabilities
    - preempt
    - clear
